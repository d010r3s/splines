## Cubic Spline
A cubic spline is a spline constructed of piecewise third-order polynomials which pass through a set of m control points. The second derivative of each polynomial is commonly set to zero at the endpoints, since this provides a boundary condition that completes the system of m-2 equations. This produces a so-called "natural" cubic spline and leads to a simple tridiagonal system which can be solved easily to give the coefficients of the polynomials.

## Parametric Cubic Spline
In the case of parametric cubic
splines, each spline segment is represented by two equations in the independent variable s:
```
x = f1(s) = a_x*(s-s0)^3 + b_x*(s-s0)^2 + c_x*(s-s0) + d_x
x = a_x*t^3 + b_x*t^2 + c_x*t + d_x
t = s - s0

y = f2(s) = a_y*(s-s0)^3 + b_y*(s-s0)^2 + c_y*(s-s0) + d_y
y = a_y*t^3 + b_y*t^2 + c_y*t + d_y
t = s - s0
```
, 

where s0 represents the value of the independent variable s at the beginning of the segment. For convenience,
weâ€™ve made a variable substitution t = s - s0.
